        COS423 Final Project <br><br>

        This is an implementation of Fortune's Algorithm for constructing
        a Voronoi Diagram. This corresponds to <a href='http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/temp/423/projects.pdf'>Project 3</a>. It requires an internet connection
        to function. It is also available online at <a href='http://www.princeton.edu/~edwardz/VoronoiDiagram/voronoi.html'>http://www.princeton.edu/~edwardz/VoronoiDiagram/voronoi.html</a>. Documentation on execution and running the code is provided on the main
        page.

        <h2> Overview </h2>
            This interactive javascript implementation of Fortune's algorithm uses
            a left to right sweep line algorithm to generate a Voronoi Diagram using
            parabolic arcs. <p>
            It provides several methods for generating points, allowing
            user specified points entered textually as a list or visually on the plane,
            as well as randomly generating points in the unit square. <p>
            We provide interactive control of the sweep line allowing the user to see
            the parabolic arcs constituting the "beach line" as they sweep out the
            partial voronoi diagram; to the left of the beach line is the voronoi
            diagram so far. The sweep line can be animated to move from left to right,
            or can be dragged back and forth by the user using a slider underneath the
            plane. The user can manually set the bounds of the view plane using the
            controls above the plane. <p>
            More detailed information about the workings of the algorithm can be
            seen in the textboxes at the bottom right of the page, showing the
            priority queue of potential sweep line events and the current arcs
            on the beach line. The user can click a button to step from event to event.
            <p>
            This project is implemented entirely in javascript. My implementation of
            Fortune's algorithm relies on the data structures provided by Google's
            <a href='http://code.google.com/p/closure-library/'>Closure</a>
            javascript library. I also use <a href='http://www.jquery.com'>jQuery</a>
            and <a href='http://www.jqueryui.com'>jQueryUI</a> libraries to provide
            the interaction widgets as well as helper functions for event handling.

        <h2> Implementation </h2>
        <h3> Fortune's Algorithm </h3>
            The core algorithm is implemented in <a href='voronoi.js'>voronoi.js</a>
            <ul>
                <li> <b> Data Structures: </b> The two core data structures in Fortune's
                Algorithm are the Sweep Line Priority Queue and the Beach Line Tree
                <ul>
                    <li> The sweep line priority queue contains event objects. These
                    objects contain an x-coordinate of the event, a type (either a SITE
                    event or an ARC event), and a reference to a point or arc object
                    depending on which type of event it is. <br>This is implemented as
                    a Closure Priority Queue, which uses a standard heap implementation.
                    </li>
                    <li> The beach line tree maintains a sorted list of the arcs in
                    the beach line. The tree key is actually a pseudo-index, since
                    what we need for the beach line is essentially a random-access
                    linked list of arcs. Thus, we take the first two elements to
                    have indices e.g. -2<sup>13</sup>, 2<sup>13</sup>; then when
                    we insert a new node between two existing nodes we simply take the
                    index halfway in between the two existing indices (going to
                    floating point indices if necessary), and new nodes at the "ends
                    of the linked list" just get a new power of 2 as an index. <br>
                    This allows easy retrieval of nodes by index, while still keeping
                    the sorted order of nodes in a binary tree form so that
                    our beach intersection is efficient <br>
                    We could implement a comparator to directly index based on the arc,
                    but this method turns out to be simpler.
                    <br> This is implemented as a Closure AVL tree,
                    which suffices as a Balanced Binary Search Tree. </li>
                </ul>
                One rather important and complex data structure stores the information
                about a parabolic arc. This data structure contains the following data
                elements: <ul>
                    <li>The coordinates of the point that is the focus of the parabola
                    (i.e. the point that generated the arc)</li>
                    <li>A pseudo-index into the beach line for this arc</li>
                    <li>References to the next and previous arcs in the beach line
                    to keep the linked-list linear time traversal </li>
                    <li> An index into the array of diagram edges (see below). This
                    index represents the edge being traced out by the upper breakpoint
                    of the arc</li>
                    <li>A static key used as a hash of this arc. This is simply
                    implemented as a string containing the concatenation of the points
                    that generated the previous arc, this arc, and next arc. </li>
                </ul>
                There are two supplementary data structures used for this algorithm:
                <ul>
                    <li>A hash table that maps a parabolic arc segment to the
                    corresponding potential event in the Sweep Line priority queue.
                    This is used to make deletion of invalid arc events efficient. <br>
                    This is implemented as a Closure HashMap</li>
                    <li>An array of edges in the final voronoi diagram. Array elements
                    have two properties: one is a pair of edge endpoints and the other
                    is the pair of points that the edge bisects. This is used to store
                    the output of the algorithm (both partial and final)</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li> <b> Geometry Module: </b>
                A separate geometry module (<a href='geometry.js'>geometry.js</a>)was necessary to abstract out the
                difficult math. This contained simple primitives such as line segment
                intersection and distance functions. There were two nontrivial functions
                in this module:
                <ul>
                    <li>Calculating the circumcircle of three points, in order to
                    determine when an arc would disappear (resulting in an ARC event).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Calculating the center of a circle tangent to a vertical line and
                    intersecting two arbitray points. This was necessary in order to
                    calculate the breakpoints between two adjacent arcs (since
                    the center of this circle would be equidistant from the sweep line
                    and the two points generating the parabolic arcs)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li> <b> Algorithm Implementation </b>
                The main function in this implementation processes a single event from
                the Sweep Line priority queue. It examines events from the top of the
                queue, discarding previously invalidated ones. Once it finds a valid
                event, it proceeds as described in <a href='http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring12/cos423/bib/vor.pdf'>Barr et al</a>. <p> In processing
                SITE events (hitting a new point), there are two subtleties -
                searching the beach requires reaching into the "private" variables of
                the AVL tree for efficient binary search to determine where to insert
                the new arc for the new point, and keeping the sorted-linked-list
                structure while constructing the three new arcs requires some
                careful initialization. <p>
                Processing ARC events was a little more tricky because the edges of
                the diagram needed to be tracked. This is achieved by keeping track
                of the edges being traced out by the beach line. <p>
                A few edge cases needed to be taken into account when considering
                potential arc events. There are four edge cases for arc events:
                the most common is that an arc's generating point is in front of (i.e.
                has a greater x coordinate than) both of its neighbors, so that
                the arc never actually disappears and therefore does not generate an
                arc event. We also disregard events with three adjacent
                collinear sites, since the bisectors for these sites will never
                intersect. If the potential event would take place at a location that
                the sweep line has already passed, then it is certainly invalid, and
                finally if the circumcenter of three points does not actually lie
                at the intersection of the three parabolas (an odd geometric case that
                was only caught with visual debugging) then it is a false event as well.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Graphical Output and Interaction </h3>
            Much of the graphics primitives were implemented in <a href='interaction.js'>interaction.js</a>, while the interaction code is completely in <a href='voronoi.html'>voronoi.html</a>. The actual drawing code is in <a href='voronoi.js'>voronoi.js</a>.

            <ul>
                <li>Graphics primitives involved drawing circles, points, parabolic
                arcs, and lines onto a canvas. Drawing parabolic arcs was an
                interesting task since the HTML5 canvas only provides a quadratic bezier
                curve drawing function, and we used
                <a href='http://alecmce.com/as3/parabolas-and-quadratic-bezier-curves'>
                http://alecmce.com/as3/parabolas-and-quadratic-bezier-curves</a> as a
                reference for this. Two edge cases for parabolic arcs were
                endpoints with the same y-coordinate as the focus, which required us to
                slightly perturb each endpoint for the quadratice bezier curve to
                render properly, and a degenerate arc, which is simply a line. <p>
                The same object responsible for these primitives also maintains the
                list of points on the canvas as well as the location of the sweep line.
                </li>
                <li> Interaction code was very straightforward using jQuery and
                jQueryUI. The slider element and the overlay for entering a list
                of points were jQueryUI widgets<li>
                <li>
                Drawing the partial diagram on the left of the beach line was the
                hardest part of the visualization, since it was not described in the
                readings. The way in which we constructed the edges (one endpoint at a
                time) allows us to loop through the break points on the beach line
                and connect them with the appropriate edge endpoints as they trace out
                the edges; however, for an edge that is being traced out in both
                directions, we have to keep a reference between the arcs that are
                tracing out the edge so we can draw the partial edge. Any remaining
                edges already have both endpoints determined so those are easy to draw.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Note that sliding the slider leftwards usually results in completely
            recalculating the voronoi diagram up to that point, since there is no
            simple way to reverse the sweep line.
